The **AMLImportExport** software tool provides guidance for programming AutomationML export and import software interfaces. When engineering software systems or engineering tools exchange data via AutomationML, each engineering tool must have a suitable export or import data interface in order to map and translate the engineering tool-specific data objects into AutomationML objects. 

You will find here implementation examples of **AutomationML export and import algorithms.** The examples are based on specific design patterns. The program guides you through the various implementation alternatives using an easy-to-follow example AutomationML model. By means of a basic software architecture it is shown, how the transformation works and describe which concepts and strategies can be used to successfully implement export/import interfaces. Detailed explanations as well as the additional code examples can be found in the [AutomationML cook book](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783110745979/html).
