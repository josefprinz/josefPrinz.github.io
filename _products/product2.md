**AutomationML editor** has been developed by the [AutomationML](https://www.AutomationML.org) society in order to visualize major AutomationML concepts and provides functionality to visualize, create, edit and validate AutomationML/CAEX files. [AutomationML](https://www.automationml.org/about-automationml/automationml/) is a standardized data exchange format, developed to support the data exchange in automation systems engineering. The AutomationML editor is suited for educational purposes and a perfect entry point for learning, experimenting and understanding AutomationML.  

The editor supports object-oriented modeling concepts such as class-instance relations, inheritance, and generalization, making it ideally suited for teaching these concepts. Own extensions and customizations can be implemented via a public API. 

AutomationML Editor Version 6 was published in 2022, featuring a new design, improved usability, dark mode, simplified modelling of versions and derivations of classes, simplified instance generation and instance updating, extended support for the mirror concept, auto-save, integrated download of AML libraries/examples, direct access to supplementary content to the AutomationML Books, visualization of product images, auto update and new plug-ins such as AMLDraw, XMLViewer or AMLDocman, as well as many further improvements and bugfixes.

The Version 6 furthermore introduces a new license model: The AutomationML editor is still freely available but introduces some restrictions in the size of AutomationML models or the use of some PlugIns. The size restrictions are generous and do not affect its applicability for most educational and didactical purposes.

Members of the AutomationML association receive the license key automatically through membership via the members area, and the license is distributable to the entire company/organization. Members of the AutomationML association are unlimited in model sizes, and additionally can use additional functions and plug-ins.

AutomationML Editor is a C# .NET Desktop WPF Application compiled for the [.NET6 desktop runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0).
