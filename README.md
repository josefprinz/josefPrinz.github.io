# Software projects

This repository is used to publish some of my favorite projects and products. I use GitHub pages to create the content in https://josefprinz.github.io. 

Posts can be published by co-authors by inserting a new post file in the [posts](docs/_posts) directory.

The page is build with jekyll. The theme is provided by C.S. Rhymes.
