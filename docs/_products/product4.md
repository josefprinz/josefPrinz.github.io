The **AutomationML Engine** is a portable .NET class library which provides methods for processing AutomationML documents.
[AutomationML](https://www.automationml.org) is a standardized data exchange format, developed to support the data exchange in automation systems engineering. The AutomationML Engine supports the processing of AutomationML documents of version 2.10.

The core of the engine is the CAEX class model. [CAEX](https://www.plt.rwth-aachen.de/cms/PLT/Forschung/Projekte2/~ejwy/CAEX_IEC_62424/?lidx=1) is an IEC standard and the basic model of AutomationML. CAEX uses XML to define the model schema, so the core of the AutomationML Engine is an XML processor. The AutomationML Engine implementation is based on LINQ to XML.  LINQ to XML is a .NET in-memory XML programming interface that enables you to modify XML documents efficiently and easily. The classes are defined in the System.Xml.Linq Namespace. The Engine supports both CAEX version 2.15, which was the basis of AutomationML version 1.0, and CAEX Version 3.0, the basis of AutomationML 2.10.
