[**ginerO**](https://www.inpro.de/ginero/) is a software solution to support the interlock planning of robots in offline programming. The previously time-consuming and manual process is simplified, accelerated and improved by seamless integration in Siemens Tecnomatix Process Simulate (without additional hardware) and by automated generation of interlocking solutions!
With **ginerO** you can create the interlock of a robot cell fully automated. It is the only product on the market that offers this function. After configuring the operation sequence, the possible interference zones are calculated automatically and the best interlocking solutions are calculated in seconds. From these, you can choose the one with the utilization and cycle time that best meets your requirements.  **ginerO** creates the necessary synchronization signals for the interlocking of the robots and the control of the operation sequence and can also generate the OLP commands. **ginerO** offers an enormous productivity gain. You can achieve in a few minutes what you would otherwise spend several days on. 

**ginerO** is a product of [inpro](https://www.inpro.de) and is embedded in [Siemens Tecnomatix Process Simulate](https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/products/tecnomatix/).
