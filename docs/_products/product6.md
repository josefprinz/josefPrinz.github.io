The **AutomationML Toolkit** provides a set of UI-Controls and Templates, that may be helpful to visualize AutomationML models.
The toolkit is used by the AutomationML editor. The UI-controls are reactive and interact with AutomationML models, updated using the AutomationML engine.

The main UI element, provided by the toolkit is the **AMLTreeView** seen in the figure, used to visualize the AutomationML libraries as a hierarchical structure. The toolkit will automatically update a tree when the related AutomationML document is modified. Icons and styles used by the toolkit are defined in the [Aml.Skins](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aml.Skins) package.
