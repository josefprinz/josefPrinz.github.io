# Computer Scientist by passion

Hello and Welcome

My name is **Josef Prinz**

I am a software developer, based in Berlin, Germany. The main focus of my programming interests are developments for production and automation planning in the areas of simulation, optimization and data standards. 

This website showcases some of my favorite projects. I would like to tell something about these projects here and also talk about new ideas.
